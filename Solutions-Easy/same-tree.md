## Same Tree

### Question

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.


#### Example:

```shell
Input:     1         1
          /           \
         2             2

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]

Output: false
